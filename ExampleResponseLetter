## Example Response Letter 2 ##

Dear Student ____, 

Thank you for your response. I love hearing from you. 
Your questions, and suggestions are important to me, your classmates, and your teachers too. 
I hope the information I provided you to explore you interests is helpful and that you know we share something in common. 
Being a scientist, one of the most important things we do is work together to test, question, and answer many things to better understand 
the world we live in.  

Good scientific questions, will always lead to more questions to answer. Iâ€™m glad your asking questions too similar to me.  

My hope is that you will always be person that asks questions and seek to find answers. 

Remember, not all questions have clear answers that is why science is important. 
When we learn the answer to a question, we learn just a little bit more than what we knew before and we can share that knowledge with everyone.
Thank you for sharing your enthusiasm and interest in our shared love of science too. 

Signed,

___________
